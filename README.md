# kb_mover

Simple ros - rviz keyboard mover for the rviz_plugin_osvr plugin by Veix123: https://github.com/Veix123/rviz_plugin_osvr

Arrow keys to move and right shift/right ctrl to go up and down. Rotation through keyboard not implemented. 

Assuming you've followed the steps and successfully gotten the above linked rviz-osvr plugin working, just build with catkin build or catkin_make and launch with the provided launch file launch_with_kbmov.launch. It bundles everything, so that should be the only thing you need to run. Needs to be run as root.
